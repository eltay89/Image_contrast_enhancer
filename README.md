# Image_contrast_enhancer

A Python script using OpenCV and PIL libraries that will allow you to choose an image from your directory and enhance its contrast using three different techniques:

 1.   Histogram Equalization
 2.   Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
 3.   Contrast Stretching
 
It will prompt you to enter the path of the image and then ask you to choose a contrast enhancement technique. The enhanced image will be saved in the same directory as the original image with an appropriate suffix indicating the technique used.
